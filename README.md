Idea:
The idea behind ShopZ is to create an easy way to involve friends in a purchase decision via social networks like Facebook/Twitter. ShopZ helps create a friend poll in real time for product recommendations. Friends help into making the crucial ‘buy it or toss it’ decision when product reviews just don’t cut it. 

What it does:
ShopZ is an online marketplace that allows you to not only search and buy products, but also get opinions from friends before making purchase decisions. Say you're interested in buying a projector and screen. You don't know much about them, but you have some friends who do. Or you're interested in buying a denim jacket, but you want to know what your cousin thinks about it first... 

New Users would register for an account via their Twitter or Facebook profile, and ShopZ would pull their contact data. Afterwards, the user would then go into the app's online marketplace and search for, and choose an item. After picking, the user would be prompted to select friends from their social media contacts, and send them a customized message asking if they have an opinion on a particular product. 

Each product gets its own special product ID code, which is based on the user, product, and time. The recipients are brought to a landing page where they can see product information and submit feedback to the user. They don't have to download the app to send a response... but of course, we hope they do! The user can access the survey results at any time, and then make purchase decisions whenever he/ she feels ready to do so. If they want to buy, they'd then be directed to the seller's website.
